# Integrated-Arduino-and-Machine-Learning-Patient-Monitoring-Platform
A real-time patient monitoring system platform that measures heart rate, respiratory rate, and body temperature using AD8232, NTC103 thermistor, and a piezo sensor. Data is acquired via Arduino, processed with a trained ML model in Python, and displayed on an LCD along with alerts for timely intervention.
